[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mre/hyperjson.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mre/hyperjson)

A hyper-fast, safe Python module to read and write JSON data. Works as a
drop-in replacement for Python's built-in
[json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) module. It's a thin wrapper
around Rust's [serde-json](https://github.com/serde-rs/json) built with
[pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3). Compatible with Python 3. Should also work
on Python 2, but it's not officially supported. This is alpha software and there will be bugs, so maybe don't deploy to production *just* yet. :wink:

## Usage

hyperjson is meant as a drop-in replacement for Python's [json
module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html):  

```python
>>> import hyperjson 
>>> hyperjson.dumps([{"key": "value"}, 81, True])
'[{"key":"value"},81,true]'
>>> hyperjson.loads("""[{"key": "value"}, 81, true]""")
[{u'key': u'value'}, 81, True]
```

## Motivation

Parsing JSON is a solved problem. So, no need to reinvent the wheel, right?  
Unless you care about **performance and safety**.

Turns out, parsing JSON correctly is [hard](http://seriot.ch/parsing_json.php), but due to Rust, the risk of running
into [stack overflows or segmentation faults](https://github.com/esnme/ultrajson/issues) is lower (basically zero, especially in comparison to C implementations).

For a more in-detail discussion, [watch the talk about this project recorded at the Rust Cologne Meetup in August 2018.](https://media.ccc.de/v/rustcologne.2018.08.hyperjson)

## Goals

* **Compatibility**: Support the full feature-set of Python's json module.
* **Safety**: No segfaults, panics, or overflows.
* **Performance**: Significantly faster than json and as fast as ujson (both written in C).

## Non-goals

* **Support ujson and simplejson extensions**:  
  Custom extensions like `encode()`, `__json__()`, or `toDict()` are not
  supported. The reason is, that they go against PEP8 (e.g. `dunder` functions
  are restricted to the standard library, camelCase is not pythonic) and are not
  available in Python's json module.
* **Whitespace preservation**: Whitespace in JSON strings is not preserved.
  Mainly because JSON is a whitespace-agnostic format and `serde-json` stips
  them out by design. In practice this should not be a problem, since your
  application shouldn't depend on whitespace padding, but it's something to be
  aware of.

## Benchmark

We are *not* fast yet. That said, we haven't made any optimizations or even done
any cleanup yet.  
Another reason why `hyperjson` can be fast in the long-term is by exploiting
features of newer CPUs like multi-core and SIMD. That's one area other (C-based)
JSON extensions haven't touched yet because it might make code harder to debug
and prone to race-conditions. In Rust, this is feasible due to crates like
[faster](https://github.com/AdamNiederer/faster) and
[rayon](https://github.com/nikomatsakis/rayon).

So there's a chance that these values might improve soon.

## Installation

To compile the code and create an importable Python module from it, call  

```
make install
```

From there, you can simply use it from Python as seen in the usage example above.

## Contributions welcome!

If you like to hack on hyperjson, here is what needs to be done:

- [X] Implement [`loads()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.loads)
- [X] Implement [`load()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.load)
- [X] Implement [`dumps()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dumps)
- [X] Implement [`dump()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dump)
- [X] Benchmark against [json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) and
  [ujson](https://github.com/esnme/ultrajson/) (see [#1](https://github.com/mre/hyperjson/issues/1))
- [ ] Profile and optimize (see [#16](https://github.com/mre/hyperjson/issues/16))
- [ ] Add remaining [keyword-only arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#basic-usage) to methods
- [ ] Create a proper pip package from it to make installing easier (see [#3](https://github.com/mre/hyperjson/issues/3)).
- [ ] Add a CI/CD pipeline for easier testing (see [#2](https://github.com/mre/hyperjson/issues/2))

Just pick one of the open tickets. We will provide mentorship for all of them. :smiley:


## Developer guide
This project uses [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) for managing the development environment. If you don't have it installed, run

```
pip install pipenv
```

The project requires the `nightly` version of Rust.

Install it via `rustup`:

```
rustup override set nightly
```

If you have already installed the `nightly` version, make sure it is updated:

```
rustup update nightly
```

After that, you can compile the current version of hyperjson, execute all tests and benchmarks with the following commands:

```
make install
make test
make bench
```

Now just modify the source code and run the above commands again to test your changes. Happy hacking!

ðŸ¤« Pssst!...check out the `Makefile` for more commands.

## Troubleshooting

In case you want to test your changes within a virtual environment, run

```
pipenv shell
```

When you are done testing, exit the virtual environment:

```
exit
```

## Creating pretty diagrams

In order to create the benchmark histogram, you first need a few additional prerequisites:

* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)

On macOS, please also add the following to your `~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc` ([reference](https://markhneedham.com/blog/2018/05/04/python-runtime-error-osx-matplotlib-not-installed-as-framework-mac/)):

```
backend: TkAgg
```

After that, run the following

```
make plot
```
